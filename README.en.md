### Baubles
- Tail and ears, they can be dye.
- I also want to make some clothing, but I think modeling them is too hard for me, nah.

Baubles can use on armor equipment slots, also they can use in Curios.

### Collar
I am adding a functional collar, maybe that's the differential.
- You can craft it whit some leather and iron, use can open a menu to add some bauble in it.
- Collar has its own slot, put your mouse on head slot then you can see it. But if you installed curios you can put it in a collar equip in Curios. Whether to use necklace in default Curios or add a new collar equip, I am considering for that.
- There's only a bell for bauble in collar now. It can make some ringtone when you're walking (not really noisy, I think). Maybe can add more feature in it or make more bell, like draw enemies' attention or glowing effect.
- I will add more bauble for collar, like a teleporter can teleport a player that equipping it to another player.
- Try to let lead can use to player (that wearing collar (or not) ).

### Rob Shear
Rob Shear is an enchantment that use to shears.

It can shear armor or collar on player. It can use with neko's owner (or not) or a dispenser block, all are configurable.

Maybe it can use on Binding Curse? I am considering for that. Btw, use dispenser to tricks is so fun, nya!
